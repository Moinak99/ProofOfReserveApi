Scalability:
Database Optimization: Replace the in-memory database with  PostgreSQL or MongoDB to handle large datasets. Implement indexing on UserId for fast lookups.

Caching: Use Redis to cache the Merkle Root,reducing computation overhead.

Load Balancing: Deploy the API behind a load balancer .
Performance:

Asynchronous Processing: Ensure all database and cryptographic operations are asynchronous using async/await to improve throughput.

Batch Processing: For large user datasets, process Merkle Tree calculations in batches to avoid memory bottlenecks.

Error Handling: Implement global exception handling middleware to return consistent error responses (e.g., 400, 404, 500).

Logging: Integrate a logging framework like Serilog to monitor API usage and errors.
